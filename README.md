A To-do React App.
The user will be able to add their daily activities, delete ones that are irrelevant
- You start by installing nodejs
- Then you run the command: 'npm install' 
- The above command installs all the dependencies necessary to run the app.
- I also needed to use React icons hence I used the command:
  ' npm install react-icons '
- The command ' npm start' launches the server and one can view the app there.

You can view the app here 'http://her-todos.herokuapp.com/'
