A To-do React App.
The user will be able to add their daily activities, delete ones that are irrelevant
- You start by installing nodejs
- Then you start the react project using the command:
  'npx create-react-app app_name' in my case app_name is to-do
- The above command installs all the dependencies necessary to run the app.
- I also needed to use React icons hence I used the command:
  ' npm install react-icons '
- The command ' npm start' launches the server and one can view the app there.
